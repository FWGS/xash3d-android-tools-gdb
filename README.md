# xash3d-android-tools-gdb
GDB from AIDE NDK with launch script

Use this to debug xash3d on android natively.

It is recommended to use floating terminal as hiding to background may break debug.

Use libraries from `obj/local` if you are using NDK, it contains debug symbols.

You need rooted device to run gdb and logcat modes with script (until gdb support added to XashActivity)
